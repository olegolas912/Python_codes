    "In this quantum version of poker, the players are initially dealt three quantum gates that can be applied to qubits at the end of every game. Each player has their own set of qubits, but all the sets start in the same initial state. The goal is to measure as many $1$â€™s as possible after applying your gates to the qubits. Therefore, any player who has not folded by the end of a game should apply their gates in such a way that each qubit has a high probability of being in the state $\\vert 1\\rangle$."

    "Then we can create the board. Here you see there are three players, James, Lilly, and Harry. In this round James is small blind and Lilly is big blind, so they have already put money on the table. To the right we can see the gates available in the \"deck\" that the players have been dealt from. For now there are no qubits on the table, as the first three are shown only after the first round of betting. A player can choose to either check/call or fold by pressing the corresponding button or raise by entering a self-determined amount into the text box and hitting the enter button, during their turn.
